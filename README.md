""# TimeLapse"
==============
<h2>App written in Ruby, wich takes two dates in milliseconds (Unix timestamp), and returns the difference in a human-readable form with the correct words endings and with the word "and" if the seconds are present. The application will stop running when you type the word "exit" in a separate line.</h2>
<h3>For example, if the numbers "1478779621" and "1478687791" are entered - the output result will be: "1 day 1 hour 30 min and 30 seconds"</h3>
